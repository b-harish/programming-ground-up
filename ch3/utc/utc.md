# Use the Concepts

* Modify the first program to return the value 3. `return3.s`
* Modify the maximum program to find the minimum instead. `minimum.s`
* Modify the maximum program to use the number 255 to end the list rather than
the number 0. `end255.s`
* Modify the maximum program to use an ending address rather than the number
0 to know when to stop.
* Modify the maximum program to use a length count rather than the number 0 to
know when to stop.
* What would the instruction movl _start, %eax do? Be specific, based on
your knowledge of both addressing modes and the meaning of _start. How
would this differ from the instruction movl $_start, %eax?
